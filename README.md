# Twitch Clip Batch Downloader
Originally created for a friend, but might as well make it public.

## Usage:

1) Paste twitch clip urls in urls.txt, one per line.

2) Run start.bat, or run `python tcd.py` from a command line.

### NOTE:
Make sure you have python 3 installed, and set up in your PATH. If you don't want to change your PATH, edit start.bat to manually point to your python 3 installation.

Example:

Change 

`python tcd.py`

To

`"C:\Python36\python.exe" tcd.py`

Or just manually type your python install directory in the command line every time you want to run.
